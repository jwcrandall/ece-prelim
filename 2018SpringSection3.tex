\item [7.] A binary source generates a sequence of symbols with probabilities p and 1-p, respectively. Given the first symbol in the sequence, the source continues to generate symbols until the opposite symbol is generated. Let X denote the length of the sequence, including the first symbol.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Q.} Find the probability mass function of X. \textbf{Theory.} The probability mass function (pmf) (or frequency function) of a discrete random variable $X$ assigns probabilities to the possible values of the random variable. More specifically, if $x_1, x_2, \ldots$ denote the possible values of a random variable $X$, then the probability mass function is denoted as $p$ and we write
        
        $$
        p\left(x_i\right)=P\left(X=x_i\right)=P(\underbrace{\left\{s \in S \mid X(s)=x_i\right\}}_{\text {set of outcomes resulting in } X=x_i}) .
        $$
        
        $p\left(x_i\right)$ is shorthand for $P\left(X=x_i\right)$, which represents the probability of the event that the random variable $X$ equals $x_i$. The geometric distribution gives the probability that the first occurrence of success requires $k$ independent trials, each with success probability $p$. If the probability of success on each trial is $p$, then the probability that the $k$ th trial is the first success is
        
        $$
        \operatorname{Pr}(X=k)=(1-p)^{k-1} p
        $$
        
        for $k=1,2,3,4, \ldots$. The above form of the geometric distribution is used for modeling the number of trials up to and including the first success. \textbf{A.} Suppose the $1^{\text{st}}$ symbol is generated with probability $1-p_o$ and the opposite symbol with probability $p_o$. The probability mass function of the sequence length $X$ such that the opposite symbol occurs at the $k^{\text{th}}$ time is
        
        $$
        P[X = k] = (1-p_o)^{k-1}p_o
        $$
        
        where $p_o>0, k \in 1,2,3,\dots$.
        \item \textbf{Q.} Find the expected value of X. \textbf{Theory} The mean $\mu$ (or expected value $E[X]$) of a random variable $X$ is the sum of the weighted possible values for $X$; weighted, that is, by their respective probabilities. If $S$ is the set of all possible values for $X$, then the formula for the mean is:

        $$
        \mu &= \sum_{x \in S} x \cdot p(x)\\
        $$

        Given that $0<1-p<1$ we can use the geometric series formula to obtain:
        
        $$
        \left(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}(1-p)^k\right)=\frac{1-p}{p}
        $$

        \textbf{A.}
        
        $$
        \begin{aligned}
        E[X] &= \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} k(1-p)^{k-1} \cdot p \\
        & =p(1-p)^{-1} \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} k(1-p)^k \\
        & =\frac{p}{1-p} \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} k q^k, q=1-p \\
        S & =\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} k q^k\\
        &=q+2 q^2+3 q^3+\ldots \\
        qS & =q^2+2 q^3+\ldots \\
        (1-q)S &= q+q^2+q^3+\ldots && \text{geometric series}\\
        &= \frac{q}{1-q} \\
        S &= \frac{q}{(1-q)^2}\\
        E[X] &= \frac{p}{1-p} \times \frac{1-p}{p^2}\\
        &=\frac{1}{p}
        \end{aligned}
        $$
